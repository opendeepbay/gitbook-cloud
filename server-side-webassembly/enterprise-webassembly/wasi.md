# WASI

{% hint style="info" %}
If WASM+WASI existed in 2008, we wouldn't have needed to created Docker. That's how important it is. Webassembly on the server is the future of computing. A standardized system interface was the missing link. Let's hope WASI is up to the task! _**-- Solomon Hykes, Co-founder of Docker**_

The WebAssembly Systems Interface \(WASI\) is a standard extension for WebAssembly bytecode applications to make operating system calls. It is fully supported in the SSVM.
