description: Performance benchmark for the SSVM against other WebAssembly runtimes
---

# Performance

We use the Second State Virtual Machine \(SSVM\) , an open source WebAssembly runtime optimized for server-side applications, together with Node.js. The SSVM provides not only a WebAssembly runtime in Node.js, but also a compiler toolchain for Rust and JavaScript.

> While Node.js comes with a default WebAssmebly runtime inside its V8 JavaScript engine, V8 is not designed to handle the performance and complex integration requirements of server-side applications. Compared with V8, the server-optimized SSVM is more performant, integrates better with JavaScript, provides access to external enterprise resources, and supports finely grained metering.

Performance benchmarks coming soon!
